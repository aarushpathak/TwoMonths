        Seriously though, you've changed my life! I could never have ever
        imagined that someone I barely knew 7 months ago would soon become an
        integral part of my life. I can't believe how far we've come in the past
        7 months as friends and in the past 2 months as partners. I'm eternally
        grateful for your endless love, support, and kindness. I hope you know
        how proud I am of you, your artworks, and the gracious, kind, sweet, and
        innocent (NOT) person that you are. I could never have asked for
        anything more! You are <strong>perfect</strong> and I really do look
        forward to the rest of our lives together. <strong>Forever</strong> and
        <strong>always</strong>! Here's to 2 months of fun and love and hundreds
        more!!

            This was the day I realized that I'd fallen hard for you :D. Nothing
            could have prepared me for arguably one of the best, yet scariest,
            moments of my life (and a horrible day for you ahahahha). Confessing
            to one of my BEST friends that I had a huge crush on her was no
            ordinary feat, except this was more than just a crush!

          <p class="img-text">
            Never am I ever gonna forget the excitement I felt dancing with you
            every practice and our gossip sessions and calls! This picture is
            one of my favourites so far and marks one of the most memorable
            moments of my life. I love you so much!

            Our first unofficial date! I woke up with the most possible
            butterflies in my stomach and was probably more anxious than was
            thought to be humanly possible. I cherished our first time on the
            beach(es) together and our time at the pool.

            The moments leading upto this picture were frightening particularly
            because your dad was so mad at you and I was also a bit scared to
            hug you infront of a gaggle of girls! But barring that tiny wrinkle
            in an otherwise perfect day, I had the greatest first (unofficial)
            date.

          <p class="img-text">
            Looking at these images now, I can't help but think: "dang march was
            one hell of a month!". We accomplished so much, not just as
            girlfriend and boyfriend, but also as best friends. This splendid
            idea (thanks spandan!) of a promposal could not have been more
            perfect, especially considering the fact that I managed to surprise
            you despite you knowing I was going to prompose at some point of
            time.
          </p>
          <p class="img-text">
            Once again, my stomach was in knots right before you entered,
            standing there holding that board, surrounded by a hoard of people.
            I swear you could hear my heart pounding over all the commotion in
            the room. Nevertheless, the surprise, the blushing, the cuteness
            (you), was just picture perfect (hence the picture ahahahaha)

            Ok I'm not going to lie, this is definitely one of my FAVOURITE, if
            not my favourite photos of us ever. The photo, the lighting, our
            expressions, me looking at you with pure love and amusement (and a
            teensy bit of "what did u just say......?") just makes it so much
            cuter. I love you so so much and I think that that fact is evident
            whenever I look at you, photo or otheriwse!

            The sleepiness in my eyes from staying up late talking to you as
            usual is quite noticeable in this image lmao. I treasured this
            moment with you, eventhough it was some studying (but then a bit o'
            fun *winky face*)

            Yeah, there's not really much to be said about this image except
            that you make something as annoying as studying for the exams (ugh!)
            just so much more fun and enjoyable. Your smile and joyous nature is
            contagious (I'm definitely infected). Thanks for the amazing date
            and I love you so much!

            Ok by this point I've seriously lost count of how many unofficial
            dates we've been on! Is it 4? 5? 10? Who knows. All I know is that
            each and every one of them have been the absolute best thanks to
            you, I cannot wait to show you this lil surprise on our first

            Amazing! I'm all out of things to write cuz I've pretty much covered
            everything! From just how much I love every single moment with you
            to all of our inside jokes and comments. I still find it so hard to
            believe that I, the now-luckiest man in the universe, managed to
            find my soulmate so early on in life. You best believe I ain't
            letting go of you. I love you sooo muchhh!! mwahh!
